Notes application for online production and news.
I work in online production and have to field notes/updates emails every night for ATC. There is no standard for how notes are written and they are frequently written by different people in different formats. The news team references stories with the authors of those stories while online production references stories based on the headline. This means that we typically have to refer to the email rundowns to find out which story is being referred to in the notes emails. This is an unneccesary step that we are forced to take every night. The aim of this project is to streamline the notes process for the news team writing the notes and the online production team receiving the notes. 
The design of the notes would be almost identical to the rundown view in Newsflex. The different story "buttons" would be pressable, and once pressed would highlight the story indicating that it needs an update. There would be a collapsable text field for note specifics.
